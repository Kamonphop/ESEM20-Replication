The app is a bit confusing to use, but I managed to set up an account and post a pair of headphones to sell. Immediately a buyer bought them, and then cancelled the order, forcing me to repost. Then buyer number two ""made me an offer"" which was 30% less than the price I posted, but I took it, because I wanted to try the app. The buyer then reached out to me because they had the incorrect shipping address on their account- and asked me to cancel and repost, which I was unable to do because the app won't let you. So I had to ask the buyer to cancel several times which was really frustrating. Third time is the charm, I reposted after fighting the app, which for some reason, tried to make me repost at a different amount. When I finally made the sale the buyer kept asking me weird things like if the headphones were real, or if I had more, or what the serial number was. The app gave me a ""warning"" and removed any serial number I tried to share. I guess it thought I was sharing a phone number, but Instead it was blocking me from answering a real buyer question. I mailed the headphones, and it cost twice what the app predicted- which was more money out of my pocket.

Sounds insignificant, but when I'm putting a lot of stuff up for sale at once it becomes annoying very quickly.Also, I've had to turn notifications off because they became so unnecessary and obnoxious. I just want a notification when someone buys something, not if there are sales on fall items or whatever. Other than that, I love the app. It's helped me with so much.

Refunds are allowed at all times which is great. You can actually set up offers. Everything on the buying aspect is perfect.However selling off items is sorta frustrating. Usually with these apps like Depop and Grailed, you get the money as soon as you sell an item. That's a different story with Mercari. You don't get the money until the sold item is delivered. I dislike waiting for almost an entire week just to get a measly twenty dollars. I want the money as soon as I put it in shipping. Having to wait awhile for this to happen makes it hard for sellers to enjoy the app, because truly it is an amazing app. Why not make it perfect by allowing sellers to get the money up front? If people are worried about scammers, they can look at a users account and get a good look to see if they are trustworthy. A lot of the people on here are very friendly and deserve to get their money up front.

It's soooo much better than any other selling app, you get to keep way more of your earnings!! Apps like poshmark really rob you with the sellers fees, and as a buyer it automatically robs you with the absurd shipping fee of $6.49 no matter how small the item you bought was. Mercari is much more flexible with that option. I choose to pay for shipping out of my own pocket because I know that's gonna get me the best price and make it more likely to get more sales ;) So here's the one problem (hence the one star I had to take away)...there's not enough protection for us sellers. You have people who have ""recently become a member"" with no ratings, no profile pic, and no bio, who will purchase from you. These people are completely unresponsive. They will absolutely ignore your messages and rating requests from both you and mercari. So even though you've let's say, gone down on the price and shipped the item quickly to ensure quality customer service and a positive rating...they make you wait the full 3 days only to have your funds released automatically, thus robbing you of the ability to warn other sellers that this buyer doesn't rate on time. And so the cycle continues. Or even worse (in my case) if usps somehow miraculously doesn't log the tracking on your item, this person will get away with stealing your item AND getting their full refund. And no matter how many calls to usps you make, no matter how much you've kept in touch with mercari, they don't do anything about it. The seller was actually SO UNRESPONSIVE that they never even answered mercari. The seller also didn't even try to contact mercari and let them know that their item wasn't received after THREE MONTHS from it's purchased date! If I bought someone and didn't receive it, I'd request a refund after 2 weeks of waiting. She didn't contact them at all. So I know she got my item. And she got my money.

It has become my favorite online marketplace and is currently the only one I use for selling. Pricing items is very straight forward (unlike Ebay) the seller's fee is reasonable (unlike Poshmark) and there's tons of traffic (unlike Vinted). I've made over 1200 sales and most buyers have been pleasant, reasonable people. I've bought a few things on Mercari, too. I am happy with all the items I received and have encountered very few unreliable,unfriendly sellers. I'd love to give Mercari 5 stars, but there are a few changes that still need to be made: Please allow sellers to disable the ""make an offer"" feature for items priced under $10 that include free shipping. Buyers expect to get items at a lower price simply because the offer button is there. For those of us who sell only low priced items, this is a problem. As it is, we get very little money after the shipping label and the fee.  We get $2.41 for a $6 item, but we only get $1.51 if we accept the $5 offer that we almost always get. That extra $1 makes a huge difference for the seller. Also, a bundling system would make things so much better. Many buyers want to bundle items, but this is challenging and frustrating for both seller and buyer. The buyer has to wait for the seller to see and respond to their message and create their new bundled listing. Sometimes an item they want to add to their bundle gets purchased by another buyer. Once the seller gets a change to read the message, she has to edit photos, weigh the combined items, create a new listing, delete the original listings... sometimes the seller is unable to do this immediately and loses the sale because she's driving, is at work or is asleep while her buyer is shopping. Lastly, the ""Restricted Items"" list needs improvement. Most areas of the restricted list is very straightforward (no weapons, drugs, food, ect) but other areas of the list are vague. For example, most over-the-counter skincare products are allowed, but some over-the-counter skincare products will get a seller into trouble. I almost lost my account 6 months ago because of a Neutrogena Retinol serum I listed. Prior to listing the serum, I had done a search in the Mercari app and saw dozens of live listings for the exact item, many had been live for months. I was luckily able to contact an understanding Mercari employee and keep my account from being permanently closed, but it was still a stressful, horrible experience for me.

Been on here fir over a year, have 300+ active listings and over 150 transactions completed as buyer and seller. I want to like this app, but they have some MAJOR drawbacks. All is well until you have a problem. Then Customer service is hard to reach, they seem to discourage you from contacting them, then they are notorious for disappearing mid email exchange. As a buyer, should something go wrong, they will try to refund you with credits not your hard earned money, if you even get that lucky. But the worst and most unbelievable part is that they don't reply to requests for help, or stop replying to you in the middle of an email exchange. Absolutely Unacceptable.. I purchased and item that was falsely represented, and the grief I had to go through to get a ""store credit"" was unreal. Then I had another purchase that never got shipped and they started sending me demanding emails that I rate the seller within 24 hours. When I had been recieved the item!

I collect shoes for a living and I thought I'm getting hype shoes in discounted or below reseller price, I was wrong. All the penny spent on this up went all down to the drain. Their lack of better process when buyer tag a listed item fake is beyond unimaginable because they still allow the items listed. And when you request for a return because the item you received is fake, they give you the burden of making sure the actual item is faking by taking tons of photos and writing an essay like explanation on how do you know it's fake. Understably so but to hold you for days to get a response is a little big excessive. And to ask you to make more photos after you already present your case and proof is beyond me.I wish they have a better control and better process on making sure items being sell on their platform is authentic. If an item is flag as fake, they should take it down until the seller is able to prove otherwise. I'd tag tens of fake shoes but still listed.

I've had a buyer request USPS to hold her package at USPS for a MONTH without any communication and Mercari basically responded saying their hands are tied and I can try reaching out to the buyer, which, needless to say, I did without Mercari's advising. Then recently I had a buyer rate me poor, even though I had been nothing, but accommodating to her. She sent me a lower offer than my asking price, however, I accepted it and shipped same day and communicated, even though she never responded. Her poor rating of me was accompanied my the comment ""fast"". Yes, she rated me poorly due to providing fast service, which is highly unfair. I reached out to her, but to no avail. So I went to the help center and reached out to Mercari, but they simply told me that they can't do anything about it, even though it's unfair, unless I have the buyer reach out to them to change it- in order words, they wanted the buyer who purposely rated me poor for no legitimate reason to do the right thing or else they can't do anything about it. Let me add that I am a very seasoned seller and my ratings are all great, with the exception of that one.

Only issue i have is the shipping label. The first weight category listed for usps label is first class &lt;1lb, like $5 or so on mercari. When the label prints and you're ready to ship, the label reads ""15.9 lb, first class"". When in  REALITY usps first class only goes up to 13 oz for that first ""under 1lb"" category. This is a flaw on mercari ‘s end. Usps $5 first class goes to 13oz only. So when that $5 label prints and reads that ""15.9oz"" it throws off the usps worker. Sometimes it gets overlooked by usps and sometimes it doesn't. If your item is even close to going over 13oz, you may want to be ready to pay more shipping coverage bc usps could technically make buyer pay more before they can receive their package.

Their customer service is impeccable. They are always swift to resolve any issues, weather as a buyer or a seller, that you may have, like getting ratings so you can get paid, or returning items that didn't arrive as described. I feel like they always have my back. It's nice to know the sellers don't get paid until you rate them, so if there's a problem you can return the item and get your $ back without any hassle. On top of all that if you&#39;re a seller, they take less commission than the other apps for selling and buying that are similar. I'd like to also mention you can sell and buy so many different thing, not just clothes, shoes and fashion type items, you can also find kitchen, camping, fishing, electronics, toys, collectibles, things for your car, things to clean with, bath and shower items, there are so many things you can buy and sell on there, the list could go on forever. The only things I'd change would be the shipping, it can be a little high for small items. The lowest shipping is 4.25 which is kind oh high for say a pair of earrings or a lipstick that normally cost a dollar or 2 to ship.

It was also easy to get to messages and likes while in my profile which as a seller I am constantly navigated around the app to to check on sales and my listings. It is in an inconvenient location now in the upper left hand corner (?) and does not help with the user interface. Please switch it back. This is just feedback and I would really like it to be passed on to the app development team.I have over 200 5🤩 ratings from buying and selling, but I have sold over a hundred items. The problem I have is that ghost buyers buy my items and never rate me when they receive the item, dont respond to my messages or even have anything for sale or are brand new users. The only reason this bothers me is because Mercari does not make an effort to prevent this from happening to sellers. They should have a ""You list/sell an item, then you can start buying items"" or make sure they are a real person via facebook or email confirmation or something.. Even make it so that you can't buy an item unless at least one conversation is made between the buyer and seller. Recently, the past week or so, the app for me will not load. I dont know why. Its super lagging the part of the time, but mostly it doesn&#39;t load, for example when I click on an item, the pics dont load, the info doesnt load, nothing comes up except the name of the listing, I can't even search for anything or look at my own listings, this is a huge bummer for me.I have an iPhone 7 with IOS 11.2.5. And have deleted and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, etc. I need Mercari to see this is a problem for me, and may even be affecting other users.To improve the app, include a way to either a. Post more pics on the actual listing, or b. Send them directly to whoever asks via message. Also make it an option for sellers to accept offers or not and include cheaper media mail options for items in book and CD categories. Also include a way to ship items not using a Mercari label and be able to charge the buyer separately for shipping since sometimes it costs less to actually ship than the standard Mercari label prices.Also including a way to list quantities of the same item and not have the post unusable after. Like if I am selling two of the same item, one listing for both that says two are available and allows the buyer to buy one or both at the same time by pressing the quantity, the shipping is then confirmed later by the seller as to what weight category it fall into. This would be great for bundling too as well as have a cart to buy multiple items at the same time instead of going from listing to listing.And just as a suggestion, another great way to spread the Mercari brand would be to send Mercari labels to sellers to put on their boxes/packages, I think it would be cute, kinda like what amazon and eBay do already.",0,0.0,US,Mercari: The Selling App,0,1,1,0,1,20,4,4,0,3,572,2988,6,31,0,"'I do not like[2] [*-0.5 approx. negated multiplier] the new version of the app ,it makes it harder to navigate to my profile which was an easy tap before in the bottom right corner where my hand conveniently rested .[sentence: 1,-1] It was also easy to get to messages and likes[3] while in my profile which as a seller I am constantly navigated around the app to to check on sales and my listings .[sentence: 3,-1] It is in an inconvenient[-2] location now in the upper left hand corner (?)[sentence: 1,-2] and does not help with the user interface .[sentence: 1,-1] Please[3] switch it back .[sentence: 3,-1] This is just feedback and I would really like[2] it to be passed on to the app development team .[sentence: 2,-1] I have over 200 5 🤩ratings from buying and selling ,but I have sold over a hundred items .[sentence: 1,-1] The problem[-2] I have is that ghost buyers buy my items and never rate me when they receive the item ,dont respond to my messages or even have anything for sale or are brand new users .[sentence: 1,-2] The only reason this bothers[-2] me is because Mercari [proper noun] does not make an effort to prevent this from happening to sellers .[sentence: 1,-2] They should have a ''You [proper noun] list /sell an item ,then you can start buying items ''or make sure they are a real person via facebook or email confirmation or something ..[sentence: 1,-1] Even make it so that you can't buy an item unless at least one conversation is made between the buyer and seller .[sentence: 1,-1] Recently ,the past week or so ,the app for me will not load .[sentence: 1,-1] I dont know why .[sentence: 1,-1] Its super lagging the part of the time ,but mostly it doesn &#39 ;t load ,for example when I click on an item ,the pics dont load ,the info doesnt load ,nothing comes up except the name of the listing ,I can't even search for anything or look at my own listings ,this is a huge bummer for me .[sentence: 1,-1] I have an iPhone 7 with IOS 11 .[sentence: 1,-1] 2 .[sentence: 1,-1] 5 .[sentence: 1,-1] And have deleted and reinstalled the app ,restarted my phone ,etc .[sentence: 1,-1] I need Mercari [proper noun] to see this is a problem[-2] for me ,and may even be affecting other users .[sentence: 1,-2] To improve[2] the app ,include a way to either a .[sentence: 2,-1] Post more pics on the actual listing ,or b .[sentence: 1,-1] Send them directly to whoever asks via message .[sentence: 1,-1] Also make it an option for sellers to accept offers or not and include cheaper[-2] media mail options for items in book and CD categories .[sentence: 1,-2] Also include a way to ship items not using a Mercari [proper noun] label and be able to charge[-2] the buyer separately for shipping since sometimes it costs less to actually ship than the standard Mercari [proper noun] label prices .[sentence: 1,-2] Also including a way to list quantities of the same item and not have the post unusable after .[sentence: 1,-1] Like[2] if I am selling two of the same item ,one listing for both that says two are available and allows the buyer to buy one or both at the same time by pressing the quantity ,the shipping is then confirmed later by the seller as to what weight category it fall into .[sentence: 2,-1] This would be great[3] for bundling too as well as have a cart to buy multiple items at the same time instead of going from listing to listing .[sentence: 3,-1] And just as a suggestion ,another great[3] way to spread the Mercari [proper noun] brand would be to send Mercari [proper noun] labels to sellers to put on their boxes /packages ,I think it would be cute[2] ,kinda like[2] what amazon and eBay do already .'[sentence: 3,-1] [result = average (39 and -34) of 28 sentences][trinary result = 0 as pos=1 neg=-1]",0,"'App [proper noun] has been super laggy lately '[sentence: 1,-1] [result = average (1 and -1) of 1 sentences][trinary result = 0 as pos=1 neg=-1]",1,1,3.0,0.008561643835616438,0.017123287671232876,0.02910958904109589,0.010273972602739724,0.4486301369863014,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.14285714285714285,0.8571428571428571,1.0,0.0,True,0,0,Afternoon,Monday,0,159.26722222222222,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,896130944,0.3004772121041754,0

A general consensus I've heard is that we need to be able to search our own listings. While I feel this would be a useful feature, for me my biggest problem is not being able to share or re-list things without fully deleting and posting a new listing. Things easily get pushed back as they get older and new listings are posted and my items get lost in a black hole it feels. When people do actually find my item my inbox is flooded with ""is this still available"" because it's been listed for months and I've had no way to repost it or do anything to show it is in any way still active. It's really unfair we should need to lower our price and then one of the ""benefits"" of lowering our price is advertised that they will bump our listing back up to the beginning of search. We should be able to refresh our items without that being the case. Even if it was once every 2 weeks we were able to re-list each posting I believe it would save everyone a lot of time and would keep buyers aware on what is current. Many times I have passed up buying something merely bc it says it was a 6 months old posting and I cba to message the seller. In addition, if a seller includes free shipping, mercari should not be making a profit on that. Shipping is one thing and the item is another. I was under the impression the shipping price was solely to cover the cost of shipping not that mercari got 10% on that too.

I make and sell jewelry and it's usually cheaper to buy supplies and scrap silver on apps like Mercari, but they do NOTHING about scammers. They either go ahead and pay the seller and refund the buyer, or simply remove a review that had already been left. The sellers continue to sell fake stuff!! I was shocked by the responses I received from customer service. There are LITERALLY no consequence for scammers. There was a incident where a woman suspected her neighbors of stealing the jewelry I sent her as the package was empty when she opened it, and she was very nice about the entire thing. I reported the incident to Mercari, offering a full refund to the buyer, and instead they paid us both and sent me a nasty message telling me to package my items better.

I bought a stroller on this website, after a really long waiting period for it to be sent out the seller messages me to ask how to print a label and where to send it and when she can get her money. I helped as much as I could. Days later I received my package wrapped in brown packing paper. I opened it the box is badly damaged, I mean clearly this box has been put through the ringer. It has Multiple holes, tears  and crush points. Clearly this box had been damaged before wrapping it because the paper wasn't damaged at all. So she knew what she was sending me. I opened the box and the stroller had multiple broken pieces which was vital to the support system of the stroller. Meaning I can't open the stroller and have it lock in place to support my child. I logged onto the app to see about how to return it. The app prompted me to review the seller before I could go any farther. But nobody tells you that once you review the seller it completes and accepts the item. I contacted customer service and they said the same thing. Once you review them it completes the sale. I wrote a very upset email. Customer service says maybe they can allow a one time exception and to provide photos. I provided photos 6 times. Let me repeat that. 6 TIMES. Every time I received an email I responded right away and attached the photos. They kept saying they never got my photos and tried to say the request was closed so I emailed back with the same pictures I kept sending. FINALLY someone says ok I received the images but I need more of the item farther away. And I have 24 hours to provide them. I get up at 5:30 am and work 12 hour shifts at a hospital delivering babies. I received the email about 2 am. I read it on my way to work. By the time I got home from my 12 hour shift I had not provided the images in time. GOD FORBID ANYONE HAVE A LIFE TO DEAL WITH. Or children to look after. Or things to do like adult responsibilities. So now my case is closed because i didn't comply with their ridiculous demands for extra photos of things I already sent them. And this lady gets away with  selling damaged goods and I'm just supposed to eat the money I spent I stroller. I looked for 7 months at this stroller before biting the bullet, and buying it. I didn't have extra money to lose this month. Just To be slapped in the face with a broken item and no way to rectify it. This is a scam company and your better off buying things from the original store or Facebook market. DONT SHOP HERE.

All very nice, people take pride in their reviews so its motivation to shop quickly in the 3 business days Mercari allows. And to package nicely ...Mercari set great standards to achieve. I feel they have thought of most everything. As a seller, they make that easy and provide the shipping labels and clear instructions to help get the best review for yourself as a seller and a happy buyer!

I usually sell my items on apps such as Tradesy and Poshmark. Well I made the biggest mistake by selling my Saint Laurent bag on here and not my usual apps. I sold my bag to a young lady who seemed nice. Shipped it right away and she received it 2 days later. She then requested a return which was fine, but I was curious as to why so I messaged her asking why because I had sent her countless pictures and we had been messaging back and fourth for a while before I shipped it out. She never responds. I had a trip to Oakland planned for the weekend and left the day the bag was supposed to be returned. Therefore, I was not able to open the bag until I returned from my trip. Well, when I returned from my trip and opened my returned item days later. It was COMPLETELY destroyed. It looked like the young girl had purposely destroyed my bag so she could return it and get a refund (idk maybe something came up and she really needed the money, it was NOT a cheap bag) but for someone to destroy someone else item is unnecessary. Anyways, I immediately contact the Mercari support. After days of waiting someone responded and told me someone else would be in touch with me. After THREE more days of waiting someone finally responds after I reach out again and say there's nothing they can do because they can only help within the first 24 hours it is delivered and I had past that time. Well i had passed that time because I was out of town and couldn't control what day my item got returned back to me!!!

I sent my code to my boyfriend, my grandpa, and my sister. My grandpa isn't technically smart so he had me help him create his account. Later on he deleted the app because he found it kinda shady. He asked me to go on and see when his order would be here so he could close out his account completely. So I did so. With the struggle of it bringing me back to my own account. THEN my boyfriend was at work (I can give legit prove) and he asked me to log in and negotiate with a lady that was trying to purchase his laptop.  Now I get a message today saying they've notice I'm abusing it? Really? Because I logged into my FAMILY MEMBERS ACCOUNT. which I have prove of. It's just irritating that if I do that again it could potentially shut down my account. Not to mention my best friend purchased something off of there and never got it or a refund. She said many other people in the reviews had the same thing happening to them.

It went let me login and said my password was incorrect. I tried three or four times a day for over two weeks to try and get it to send me an email so I could change my password and now email ever showed up per what the app said to do if you could not login. For the last several days I have trying to contact them directly but every time I call I am on hold so long it disconnects me and tells me that my call time is too long and to try back again. Now it's just a few short days till Christmas and I find out that the item I ordered on December 4 was never shipped. When I called I asked why if their policy is to ensure that the sender send the item within three days why that wasn't done. They said I had to call them and request that they contact the seller or refund my money.

Literally,"These people are quick to ban for no reason play so many run around games to give you your money. Takes months for that. And even after it's a wrongful ban they require every drop of private personal info possible that they can get from you in order to make sure you can't ever return to their marketplace. Honest sellers can't even thrive on there to be real. Their entire marketplace is literally just spam posts of counterfeit products. Maybe 10% of all listings is actually genuine product. Also you have no way of refusing to give any of that private info without them illegally holding your funds hostage until you do. If you don't they will literally never give you your money. And if you do they still make you wait 90 days.The support on there is complete garbage. Even offerup with only having email support and very minimal responses from social media they have better support. Mercari offers no protection to the sellers only the buyers. If a buyer requests a return expect that Mercari auto accepts it within an hour even if you as a seller reach out with proof that you sent exactlywhat you claimed to send.

The listings are no longer free which does effect prices now- but that's not even my issue because you can always find a good deal anyway.. my only issue— and it is a big one, in my opinion— is that the buyer protection is a load of crap! You need to be very very careful of what u but from this app, because I'm out a good bit of money on a fake pair of jeans. I am not against a good knock off now- but I don't want to pay an authentic brand price for something that is clearly not authentic. When I requested the return, and stated how the jeans I spent a good bit of money on- were clearly not authentic. My request was denied with no explanation and the purchase was completed and I'm just out all of the money that I spent and stuck with a knock off pair of jeans that aren't even the standard length for the brand (talking like 3 and a half inches) so now, not only do I have the fake jeans- but the tag says one length and they measure way shorter- so of course they are too short for me!! Can't even wear them! I have many many pairs of authentic jeans in this brand- it's the only brand I really wear.. and these are so clearly not the same quality and have weird tags and no rivets to hold the back label on- which they are known for! Absolutely ZERO help from customer service! I have been buying from Mercari faithfully for the last 5 years.. and have never had a problem. But the minute I did have an issue- I received no help, and was left to take the loss. I will NEVER recommend this app to anyone I know again- because I'd hate to know that I directed them here, just to get screwed like I did. I'm not sure if I'll be able to order with any confidence from Mercari again. I think I'll just stick with eBay- they have a REAL buyer protection program and if an item isn't as described- customer service will be right on it! They go above and beyond to make sure buyers and sellers don't end up screwed over!

Once you pass the 3 day mark, it doesn't matter if you are totally in the right about an issue, Mercari will not assist you and in fact will not even allow a seller to fix the problem as returns or exchanges are not allowed after the 3 day period.  In my case, we bought an item to be used as a gift and gave it to our child a few weeks after purchase.  The item looked just as it should from the outside, but unfortunately the seller had made a mistake and the item received was totally different then what had been described.  This was a good seller that had made an honest mistake, but because more then the 3 days had passed, Mercari will not allow the seller to exchange or return the item.   As I was using this item for a gift, I couldn't fully inspect the item until it was opened by the recipient.  Just read the complaints on here and you will see Mercari has the exact same response if you need few days (perhaps you are waiting for a weekend) to assemble a larger purchase.  If something is broken or missing, they will not allow a return/exchange simply because it has been more then 3 days, they don't care about the specifics of the case and will just send you a canned response.  I could understand a reasonable limit of time, like 30 days, but 3 days is way too short to allow for real buyer protection.  I bought a small item, with limited value, so it is not a big deal, but I can only imagine how badly you could get burned if you bought expensive electronics or something of that nature.

My issues lie within the buggy and clunky search options and Boolean term effectiveness.My biggest gripe is the fact that I can&#39;t permanently turn off the &#34;any&#34; option when searching for items.  Every search entered defaults to allow both things for sale and items that have sold. So if I adjust options to show only items currently for sale, then change my search slightly, it reverts back to show both sold and items for sale. Which tends to clutter the listings. Showing sold items is a great feature, and I&#39;m fine if that&#39;s the default, but PLEASE allow me to turn it off permanently.Also, please fix whatever bug is causing the slow searches in the latest version. Every time I search, the entire drop down search history list pops up and then the search commences. Which wasn&#39;t the case in my last update.

I have been scammed and the seller nor the app have been helpful whatsoever. Below is my review of the particular seller I went through. ""I received my laptop, it was not disclosed to me that the charging port on the computer was messed up so that it only charges when you plug it in a specific way. My husband and I have only been able to plug it up to charge 2 times in the 2.5 days I've had it. The seller nor the app were helpful at all. The seller told me to use someone else's charger, but it wasn't the charger! It was the port on the computer itself. She was no help whatsoever and didn't even try to help me until I told her I was reporting her to the app. Which brings me to my next complaint! This app is such BS. It claims they have a 3 day return guarantee, but do not offer a way to file for a return. It is such a huge scam I can't even begin to tell you how angry I am at this whole situation. I've emailed customer support through Mercari, and I have not heard a single thing.

They say there is a return guarantee, but when I went to file for a return, all it kept giving me was the runaround with articles and FAQs. I sent the email to customer support and have never heard anything back.

One buyer reached out to me wanting to keep item but demanding refund!?!I said I would do a return but would not refund without my item back, duh. She insisted, cursed, threatened, lied and made up excuses to try to explain why she wanted both ends of our deal... including she threw in dumpster! Since I refused to let her keep both, she started a return claim, then she cancelled it within a few hours &amp; rated me. I cannot see her review until I review her, but I have a pretty good idea of the content, and she had to lie about me considering the situation. I asked for help from customer service, they were on my side and seemed outraged at the buyer's behavior like I was, but were no help to me, in fact were more than unhelpful and even hurtful. After talking with a few reps, the last guy told me that I had to accept her defamatory libel statement on my page, &amp; HAD TO rate within 24h or they will automatically rate her ""for me"". However if you don't reach out to support you can go months without rating your buyers without problems.

Do not sell on this app!","I am a seller by the name Vangbac on this app. I believe that I am being scam by this company. They don't release my funds for products that I sold, shipped, and already received by buyers! 5 days ago, I created a seller account to sell my LEGO Disney Castles item# 71040. These I bought inside the LEGO Stores in Maryland back in 2016. These were meant to be hold on to because everybody knows that LEGO were collectible until recently when LEGO company decided to remake all their old, retired sets! Therefore, there's no point in holding onto these sets for resell 5 or 10 years from now. I decided to resell these to get back some of my money and cut some losses.I sold a total of 7 sets within 4 days and shipped out all 7 to my buyers. 3 buyers already received their purchase and were really happy. They wrote great reviews and gave me 5 stars. With each sets I sent out to my buyers, I also included a copy of my purchased receipt to prove their authenticity so the buyers can sleep good. These were sold from $310-$330. Yes, not cheap at all. I made a total of $2,300+. However, I only received $804 so far and $1,450 still processing. I tried to withdraw my funds, Mercari support contacted me and ask to verified my identity in which I'm happy to comply. I gave my Driver License picture ID, my social security number, my bank account information, my Facebook verified, my proof of home address. Everything! They said that they're still not satisfied and that I must wait for their specialist agent to contact me to resolve this verification! It's been almost 48 hours....no one contact me. I tried to contact them, still nothing. Now, $2,300 is in their account and I already sent out all my sold items via UPS to my buyers, but I cannot withdraw my funds. Please, please think twice before you start selling on this App! Stick with eBay or Amazon since their American companies. This Mercari is not an American company and this seems to me like a scam!

I use poshmark, eBay, Vinted, etsy and depop, too, but Mercari is the one with consistent sales for me with clothes, shoes and household items. Perks: 10% selling fee. Good customer service. It's easy to list from my phone and now I can show up to 12 photos of each item. There's NO listing fee, which can make a difference when choosing which platform to place an item. Buyers generally get a better price on Mercari than other sites, too, because sellers mark up items to cover fees. That's just business. Suggested for future versions: 1) Video! A short video, in addition to 12 photos, could help show that an item works or what it looks like in motion. Or even limitations or defects. 2) Digital downloads: lots of sellers offer digital products for immediate download. Etsy sellers pay .20 per listing, per download, every 120 days. That .20 adds up! A lot of Etsy sellers would happily migrate over to Mercari to give it a try. That would require different fees, though. Mercari would have to allow for $1 to $4 digital sales. Something to think about for future versions, perhaps. 3) Shipping changes: shipping is high everywhere. I'm not picking on Mercari. However, if they could offer shipping in a few more weight categories....right now a pair of jeans in the 1 - 3 pounds category is $11 by USPS. I suggest a 1 - 2 pound category at $7 or $8 in addition to a 2.01 - 3 pound category at $11. Poshmark offers flat rate shipping of around $7 for up to 5 pounds. But they also collect sales tax. This probably isn't far off for every platform, though, so enjoy the tax free status on Mercari while you can. When I'm buying, I check Mercari for free shipping first, then poshmark for the $7 shipping.
