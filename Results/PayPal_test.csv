Assuming I do not mistakenly input a wrong number or letter into one of these options, the account comes up WITHOUT a photo or a PayPal.me identification handle (paypal.me/JohnSmith ) to confirm I&#39;m sending the money to the correct recipient. And in this state, I can actually send the money, to the number/email (hopefully not mistakenly put in) without any other identifying characteristics. Let&#39;s just take a moment to digest how patently error-prone, unsafe and absurd this process is....Only after the transaction has sent do I get to see these identification handles. In my humble opinion, seeing some other confirming information about the account I&#39;m sending money to is critical information to see prior to the sending of that money...this would reassure me that I&#39;m not sending it to a different account with a slightly different phone or email. The margin for error via this process is much much higher than it should be... And then the only way to cancel that transaction is to go on the website (not the app). This last part doesn&#39;t bother me nearly as much as the previous things. Here are some possible solutions: If there was at least a way to save previous recipients of money transactions in my PayPal app I would not have to type in the same number/email in every time to send the same person money. Another option would be when I type in the phone number or email it comes up with the PayPal.me handle and/or their picture.  Another option would be to offer users to connect with their social media apps and contacts so we can easily get to the people closest to us.

I connected pay pal to my bank and bought some concert tickets. I ended up selling those tickets due to change of plans and the funds were refunded back into my PayPal account. PayPal had no trouble at all taking money from my bank to pay for online transactions, but transferring the refund back into my bank account was a total nightmare. The funds wouldn't transfer to my back. I was on the phone with PayPal customer service 5 days in a row, waiting 30 minutes to talk to a real person and each time I called no help was given to me. I was told to transfer it to family member or friend, that didn't work, I was told to cash it out, that also didn't work, I was told to call my bank. The bank said my account was open. The customer service said they tried to allow the transaction to be made on their end but nothing worked. They were unable to answer the question as to what the problem was and ran me around in circles telling to me try all these different options to transfer the money, and then I was told that all those changes I've been making on my account is what was blocking the transaction in the first place. Each day I had to wait 24 hours to try again. Finally I ordered a PayPal cash card. That finally worked. However, I was expecting that money in way sooner than PayPal was able to do so. I got charged bank over draft fees at $35 each because I had scheduled payments coming out of my bank during that time. The customer service didn't seem to really care about my problem and sent me running in circles. I understand that technical issues are out of a persons control, but the staff should at least be able to tell me by the first or second time of me calling in, to be able to provide me with the correct directions of how to fix my problem, the quickest way. This whole experience was beyond stressful. I have a hard time understanding why PayPal worked so fast and easily when they were pulling from my bank, but so much trouble transferring money back into my account.

It especially proves its worth when shopping online as no matter what website or service you use to buy something - as long as you used paypal to make the purchase, your money is protected and if you ever buy something that does not match exactly how it was described to you online in the item&#39;s listing then paypal will refund you completely, this goes for any website that says they no not accept returns or refunds. Paypal also has a credit program which is separated by purchase so each purchase has its own terms and you will only be charged interest on a purchased or subscription if you do not pay off the money owed for that item within the time you have selected and the max amount of time you can choose is 40 months. you can use this to purchase items you can&#39;t pay for all at once or if you want to build your credit score. The more you use it and pay things off on time the higher your overall limits will be. Paypal can also be used like venmo to send money to friends or lend money to others with pay pal accounts (of course these transactions are not protected which is why it is only recommended for family and close friends. This is done via the paypal.me account and link you can send people who can click your link to pay you. Paypal can also be used like a normal checking account with multiple ways to add or deposit money into your account, they also have a Debit Card Paypal visa that you can get to really turn it into a standard checking account. Paypal has always been one step ahead as far as banking technology and they were the first way to pay for anything online. Don&#39;t forget there is also paypal business where you can accept credit card payments and send invoices and keep track of client and customer data and payment records. If there is any banking feature paypal does not have now, best believe they will have it soon and in most cases it will be a step above the others.

They answer to nothing,"Before you assume I did something wrong, realistically I didn't. I had a business and a personal account to separate finances. I sometimes sent my direct deposits to my PayPal cash personal account and then to my business Paypal (this is allowed, I asked Paypal). I bought normal things with PayPal checkout, had a few customer orders (no chargebacks or disputes ever). Yet once my 1% cash back started to accumulate per month, since I was making loads of purchases, they waited until a merchant sent me funds back on a return to limit me permanently with $6000. Unless you get the US-based customer service reps on the phone, you're probably gonna have a rude experience with a Filipino rep. And even then, the USA ones don't know why decisions were made, nor can they do anything to change it (even up to the product manager level). Incredible in 2019 that algorithms with biases answer to nobody and allow Paypal to hold onto your living wages for 180 days. In light of the AppleCard fiasco, I hope Paypal's automated actions get scrutiny and that a real human with veto powers is added. I would love to have continued to use PayPal but now I'm just filing the following, and I encourage anyone else to do so as well especially if you're unsure of where to go: file a money transmitter complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) against Paypal. Also file complaints to the CFPB against The Bancorp and Wells Fargo as they hold the funds for Paypal on your behalf with their debit card products. This may lead you to filing complaints with the Office of the Currency Comptroller (OCC) and FDIC. Next, contact your attorney general or state business financial division that regulates money transfers. Also send one to the California AG, and finally file a notice of dispute addressed to Paypal's legal team, more info can be found googling for Paypal Notice of Dispute page.

I then contacted PayPal and asked if I should drop my DISPUTE and they said no, let them (PayPal) handle it all. So before I ended the call; I kept my dispute active. A day later I received an email saying my dispute is dropped in favor of the company I ordered the cleats from. PayPal said the reason for is because I dropped my dispute which is I a complete lie! After calling PayPal again and arguing I didn't drop my dispute they still claim I did. I told PayPal to go and listen to their recording of my conversation with them. When I was placed on hold, and later talk to; nothing was helped towards my favor. PayPal insisted I contact my credit card company and file a dispute with them. This entire ordeal in my opinion was BS. This has been since November 2018, and even making contact with this company about my sons cleats, they said they would send me a pair for him.

I have not had any problems using the card and transferring my cash back is pretty simple too. The app however has a learning curve and is not very easy to use.  I have it figured out but it's still a pain so I use my computer much of the time.  I'm giving it three stars because it works for the most part. I can't do everything I want and I would definitely recommend they check out the ease of the American Express app or the Chase bank app. These both have a great design and are very easy to use.

For shopping on eBay, there is no better way to pay. Same, in my opinion, goes for paying or sending money to friends, family, and individuals. HOWEVER, their anti-gun policy is a massive negative in my opinion. If I want to use PayPal to legally buy guns and/or accessories from a reputable store, I should be able to. Their anti-gun policies do absolutely nothing to stop criminals from buying guns illegally (ie ""on the street"") because A) Criminals buying guns illegally don't want a paper trail so likely wouldn't use PayPal anyway and B) If you can use any app to send money to someone, then it is essentially allowing anyone (including criminals) broader access to funds. For example, a criminal illegally buying a gun or drugs, or maybe an average person acquiring the services of a prostitute, or whatever, may not have cash and of course can't use a credit card directly to pay an illegal seller/dealer. However, if they can, and choose to, use a credit card through PayPal (or any other money transfer app for that matter), they can pay for anything they want (including drugs, guns, stolen goods, etc). So like most restrictive anti-gun policies, they do nothing to prevent illegal activity (and as stated above actually inadvertently offer broader options to these individuals), and only negatively affect honest law abiding people and legitimate businesses. It's ridiculous and serves only to limit legitimate business/consumer transactions. To believe otherwise is at the very least naive.

I finally was called back by same number which I answered. Victoria was on the phone, of whom I was unable to understand. She kept asking me questions for security. Some over and over again.

I was always told that it was the safest way to pay for things. And in that sense of paying for goods online, it very well may be. But to use this app for ""instant"" money transfer (similar to apps like Venmo) it's a nightmare. My boyfriend and I had been using the app for money transfers to each other (for rent and utilities) for the past year. And PayPal will arbitrarily decide to hold our funds for weeks before releasing them. For whatever reason, the past three months consecutively both our rent and our utilities were held as ""pending"" for over a week, which made us late paying some of them. Because for the person sending the money, it shows that you paid it and the money is deducted from your bank account. So it's not even like you can go and pull the money out once it's in pending. But for the person receiving it, it'll show pending for up to THIRTY days. So now we either have to have an additional couple grand in our account to have just in case PayPal randomly decides to put a hold on my funds, or start using a different payment transfer app. Obviously PayPal doesn't help with any late fees their pending status accrues, and it doesn't help with our standing with our utility companies.

I thought maybe I could get them to enter my debit information over the phone. Of course not!

I started a job at home where my employer only uses PayPal to pay. 1st check was great. There was a 24 HR waiting period. Got my money. Perfect. Then I tried to get cash at at Walmart. After an embarrassing time of 10 denials, no cash. People looking at me crazy. But my account showed I had money. So I ordered the card. Got that timely. Works great. But now my paychecks are being held for up to 21 days. Because Paypal feels like it. That&#39;s crap. My bank account has been overdrawn twice now. I get paid on Monday and don&#39;t see my money for 7-10 days. That&#39;s bull. I spoke with Customer Service and they were very quick to tell me that this was industry standard. I was just as quick to explain that EVERY bank has a provision for payroll. They told me too bad. I showed them the couple of times they paid within 24hrs. They said it was my employer. I explained no bank in the US held anybody &#39;s check for a 7 day period. They explained they can choose to hold any check they want. And so its mine.  I&#39;m on day 7 of my final check being held with this crummy company. I&#39;d rather deal with an organization that has enough integrity to pay people&#39;s payroll timely.

I had talk to them over and over again I had read the fine print I had sent letters to high ups I had sent requesting emails and no one could help me.

The same company that sold me the defective ABS unit, offered to buy it back and I agreed, but then after they got it back they said that they didn't like it and that it didn't work. I told them that it didn't work and I complain that they had sold it to me and it didn't work. The seller said in an e-mail ""I will accept $15. "" If you send me $15 but it will help cut my losses. But I did send the $15, I don't know what happened, but I didn't hear from the seller again until he put in a claim to PayPal for $52.

I am so angry with PayPal I am removing all my transactions off of their platform. Even though I won't cancel my account in case of an emergency, I won't be using PayPal for daily or ordinary invoices and Business receipts and AirBnB - I used to use it all the time. I will not deal with a company that is so biased and square headed. I was treated unfairly and I am very angry at PayPal. Also I do not like that helpless feeling that they can swoop in and take my money at anytime they want. This guy made his refund request almost 5 months after he received the part. If that was the case I should've gotten a refund from the first time when I discovered it was defective when I paid $98. PayPal has two sets of rules and I don't like it.

Also, PayPal credit is amazing and has allowed me to build my side hustle and because I use it so well and keep turning money over and paying my purchases off fast, PayPal keeps increasing my limit automatically, it's awesome.  I love that it now helps my credit score but the only thing I do not like is the interest rate.  I would like my interest rate to go down because I'm doing so well.  If I ever have to pay interest then it would end up being quite a bit.  Luckily, almost everything I buy has 6 months interest free if paid in full so I only buy something when I know I can pay it off in 6 months.  The only tip, when you go to make a payment, they will automatically apply your payment to the next item on the list and that may not necessarily be what you want to pay off first. You may want to put money towards something that will start collecting interest so you have to contact them and let them know how to allocate those funds. I think it would be nice if we could let them know where we want the money located somehow through the app, maybe put a note somewhere or let us directly allocate it ourselves.Other than that, Customer Service is actually awesome which means EVERYTHING to me... having said that, it's hard to get ahold of someone right away via in app messaging so I have found that it is easier to call because you get a real human fairly quick and they are ALWAYS kind and get the job done and get it done correctly.  PayPal customer service has been amazing and understood all of my small issues and have fixed everything that they could on their end.
