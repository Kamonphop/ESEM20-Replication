My account keeps locking when I try to authenticate. I walk through the steps to unlock and then it puts me right back in the same loop.  The only way to resolve is to call the 800 # and get a temporary passcode (thankfully that process works).  After multiple failures, it would appear that it is locking the account / looking for the account details for the first account in alphabetical order (which happens to be a custodial account with my daughter) vs what I expected to be my primary account. I wouldn't have known this without my account getting locked multiple times and an email stating my account had been locked on my daughters account. Resolution:  Let me select the account details I want to provide to unlock my account (which I'm still unsure as to why it is locking).  Here's the user story all written out for you:  As a BofA mobile user, I want the ability to select which account details to use to unlock my password so I can use the mobile app. Bonus points if you can fix the bug that keeps locking my account. Help me help you. I'm happy to walk through the scenario with your product team and get to a resolution for all.   I'm ready to give you a five star review if we can solve this.

The new digital assistant is surprisingly helpful. There's still some quirks here and there. For example, I have Touch ID enabled to log in - which wasn't asked by default so it took me a while to realize this app supported Touch ID. I then enabled two-step verification on the WEB for when I use Online Banking on the web. Now every time I log in on the app AFTER Touch ID I still have to get texted a code and enter it in. Enabling that on the web also turns it on after Touch ID which is super annoying. Almost Bank of America. Almost 5-stars.
