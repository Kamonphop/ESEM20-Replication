It's more reliable to read it yourself if there's rain or in this case, a spontaneous blizzard in the middle of April), when I discovered that the app takes 30 seconds to buffer, then immediately crashes back to my wallpaper. But, when I looked in the running background apps thing, it was there and so I clicked on it. I don't know if what I was seeing was real or not, but it showed the normal degrees and the little radar thing, but then it froze and crashed again.

What I like about this app, is the radar picture showing incoming storms. That is pretty accurate. When we're out of town, I enjoy checking out the webcams, especially in the winter. I can see if there's any snow or rain at home. I like the traffic webcams too. I not only check our weather forecast but also have at least 13 other towns where friends and family live so I can check out their weather too. When we're traveling by car and I'm not sure what town we're in, I just turn on the Weather Bug app and town at the top of the list is where we are. Sometimes I check the app 4-5 times a day. There are also some very nice photos that people have submitted. I have 8 weather apps on my iPhone and this app is always the first one I check.
