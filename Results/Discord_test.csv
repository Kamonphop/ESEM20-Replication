I know people who basically run businesses with this application. It has huge organizational capabilities. If you name it it can be done! Robots can even be programmed to monitor and perform basically any task. this is a complicated platform to use and learn without a doubt but when you learn the inner workings...Nothing in the gaming world or in any type of chat application is better. The one downfall is most photos have to be cropped or you have to change certain settings and you cannot share videos. They have to be linked, usually the YouTube is the best. Other than that it is flawless in every way and can be modified to do whatever you want as far as communication.  Furthermore the customer support and keeping you up-to-date and communicating with you as a user is unpaired.  Using this platform for two years now and will continue to use it for the for seeable future, It's just amazing all the way around! It's completely free! Certain robots are purchasable but they are cheap With amazing features.

This would help with bigger discords. Let's say in a gaming community you have Minecraft servers and gmod servers. You can have 3 bigger categories with general, gmod, Minecraft. With a smaller category in each for whatever you need with text channels in them. This would be easier than having multiple discords for same discord and having it more centralized. Another thing I think would be cool is add more discord options onto Xbox, not just showing what game you're playing. I was thinking you could maybe join voice channels or make discord calls via Xbox, it can kind of look like what Spotify looks like on Xbox.

I get mobile is behind and you can't really get all the features, and of course it'll be different, but I absolutely HATE that calls act as phone calls now. The sole reason I switched from typically using FaceTime Audio calls to Discord calls was to be able to lock my phone while talking, have my phone on my bed without the screen turning off when something covered the sensor, other people not being able to see what or who I was talking to, and it not stuffing up my call logs. Discord used to be wonderful. The thing that bothers me the most is not being able to lock my phone without the call ending. An absolute pet peeve of mine and it's awful. Please please take it away, we were FINE without it. Stop trying to be FaceTime.EDIT: You've now gained back my affection, discord.

That being said, never since Xbox Live have I paid for a service that is constantly down.  The updates frequently ""fix"" what isn't broken (god knows how many UI updates there have been to this app, each one worse than the last, with very few helpful functions included).  It is the only app that has a major issue with GBoard, it freezes, hangs, lags, disconnects, crashes, you name it.  Call quality has become unbearable on both LTE and WiFi with 150mbps down/45mbps up, my friends in Europe almost never successfully connect to calls, even just voice.  I've used Skype for a decade, and never have I had issues this bad.  Sure, Skype goes down, but nowhere near the same rate as this.  About the only thing Discord has going is custom emotes, something game-changing.  However, if Skype introduced the same thing, I would leave Discord in the dust and would even pay MORE for a more stable platform.  As-is, I'm contemplating dropping my support, even at a couple of bucks a month.  It's not worth it to support a service that is rarely 75%+/- functional.Tl;Dr: Paid for Nitro for a long time, tired of doing so because app is unstable and buggy, with little sign of improvement over two years time.UPDATE: They now has callkit, which is awful integration and buggy as hell.  Additionally, they put buttons in the UI in stupid places (e.g. join voice chat right below the send message button. Nothing I love more than blaring voice chat through my phone and disconnecting from my PC. Thanks discord.).  Combine that with this idiotic appeal to competitive gaming, which few to no players care about (as demonstrated by the failed Discord Games section on PC, oops).  Still very curious where my money is going to.  Discord needs to be focused on its single task: Community chat.  It's not a gaming service, it's not a competitive gaming/streaming broadcast studio, it's a chat utility for gaming communities.
