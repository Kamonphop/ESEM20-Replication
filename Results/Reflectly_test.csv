I've had the app for about two weeks now and have done entries every single day and there are a few things I would want to be changed. 1) Reflectly gives you ""thought invoking questions"" every day in the daily entries. However, i have found that they are a bit repetitive. For example, here are two questions I got. A. ""Who do you look up to? Why is that?"" And, ""Do you have a mentor?"" Also, ""what do you spend most of your time on?"" And ""what is the biggest waste of time in your day?"" I do understand that these questions are not the same but they are just a few examples of questions I have been asked that I find myself answering the same thing to. So I guess what I would want to be different is the type of questions they ask you. 2) Reflectly does not allow you to link videos to your daily entries, however they do let you link photos. This may be because of how much storage videos take up and that may make it impossible, but if it is possible it would be nice to be able to link videos. Things I like about Reflectly1) The price. This is one thing I don't really have a problem with. I'm paying $40 for 365 days worth of online diaries. That's a good deal to me. 2) The UI. It is a pretty simple app to use and the software glitches are pretty few and far between. However, I wish it was easier to access entries you made previously. It takes a while for me to scroll to my first entry even though I've only made about 14 of them. I would like it if there was some sort of menu you could access that could allow you to scroll through previous dates to find the entry you want to find.

Next, you get to write all about your day and what happened that made it so amazing or horrible. After that, you get a question of the day. It could be anything. My first one was, ""What was the most embarrassing moment you ever had?"" Then it gives you space to answer. That's just the writing portion of the app. Next you get ""personal stats"" which you have to pay for with premium. I can't really say anything about premium, because I don't have it, but I think this app is definitely worth trying! Please try it and tell your friends.

I saw reflectly by chance on a YouTube ad, and thought ""hey! That might help me keep track of my feelings!"" So I downloaded it and I LOVE IT! I logged all my days from the past week, and tried the free trial for the + version (I'm subscribed now). I love the fact that it shows you how your improving over time! I noticed lots of helpful things that I can talk to my counselor about! I can even show her my entries, which I'm already excited to do! I have ADHD, so I often forget to do things. However, at the end of the day, I've been excited to write about my day, no matter how it went or what happened. I also really like how it has a place for daily pictures. It helps me want to get outside and take some pictures and make a day that's gonna make a cool entry! I don't know why, but reflectly is working! I've tried paper journaling before, but it just feels like I'm talking to myself, you know? Reflectly makes it feel like someone is listening to you and cares about how your day went. I found that keeps me motivated to log another day. I've been doing so much better and I feel so much less stressed now that I can wright down how my day went.

The only thing I am a bit dissatisfied with is the lack of options that the people who do not want to pay a subscription for the ""premium"". (Keep in mind that the subscription is QUITE a bit of money!) So reflectly, I would really appreciate it if you guys could add some more options for the people who don't want to pay the monthly subscription. Other than that, I would love to elaborate on how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this app! First of all, this app helps so much with daily check ins (if that makes any sense) on how the users of this app days are going, and the way that this app doesn't just leave us all struggling (this is me) to search our mind of what to write about the day we had— it gives us good and realistic questions to answer. I also must add that the feature of adding pictures to the journals is amazing because you never know when one of us users may want to sneak in a pic of a nice day at the beach, cool food etc. overall, I love this app and am looking forward to the future updates.

It's so fun to write your whole day down. What your mood was, the things you did today, and then you can look back at all those stories. Which is a lot of fun and very relaxing. I do have a couple of problems though. So I was browsing and I accidentally hit the log out button. Obviously you can log back in, but when I logged back on everything was gone. I was literally going to cry. The whole thing was gone, it said I had no stories or streaks or anything. I was able to download my data and get it sent to my email, but I then had to rewrite everything. Which I was willing to do. I started writing one then went to bed. I woke up and looked at it and it was still gone. The poof it's all back, I don't know how but it was all back there. Ok my next problem. I do love Reflectly but to only be able to do one thing in not premium is annoying. So basically you have to enter 7 stories and you unlock your status. Then I'm going to look at my status and it says you have to have premium. I will pay for premium but I don't want to, I'm going to save up my money. I read this in one review and I thought it was a good idea. You could complete like a certain amount of stories to unlock let's say status. Actually unlock it though, be able to look at it and everything. So personally if this was my game I would do this.

Considering every add Snapchat has that is a game you have to pay for to actually get the thing you came for. I thought Reflectly was one of those. A little trick Snapchat tried to do to get money. It kept popping up, I finally decided to download it. I never had an app like this on my device, so I was kinda confused. It is actually a really easy app to use! May is mental health awareness month, so it was another reason I wanted it. I took baby steps at first like getting more sleep, waking up earlier, and eating breakfast. These steps would help me be more productive in school and all, but I felt they didn't really help me mentally. Reflectly has so many cool gadgets to make you be able to keep track of your emotions this is including dates, stickers, and images! They also provide questions. The question always have something to do with your description of your day. For example: i had a story titled ""Linda and Heather :D!"" Reflectly always asked what happened, a question, and notes. My question was ""What was your screen name?"" If you don't know a screen name is a character or person you identify as. I was Heather and she was Linda. Both characters of a show!
